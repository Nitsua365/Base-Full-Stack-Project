# Base-Full-Stack-Project

## Purpose
The purpose is to setup a base fullstack backend project to encourage rapid development and deployment of new app ideas that I have.
Essentially create all of the basic Auth, Storage, API, and Database services that most apps require. Also create a framework of
rapid deployment through Infrastructure as code (IaS).
